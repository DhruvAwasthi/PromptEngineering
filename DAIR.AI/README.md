# DAIR.AI - Democratizing Artificial Intelligence Research, Education, and Technologies
[DAIR.AI](https://dair.ai/) provides various resources on prompt engineering, and machine  
learning including lectures, blogs, courses, and much more.   
<br> 
Motivated by the high interest in developing with LLMs, DAIR.AI have  
created a [prompt engineering guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/) that contains all the latest research  
papers, learning guides, lectures, references, and tools related to  
prompt engineering.  

## Prompt Engineering Reading Guides
The prompt engineering reading guides cover everything from introduction  
to advanced prompting, and applications of prompting.
