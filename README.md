# Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and   
optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs) for a wide  
variety of applications and research topics. Prompt engineering skills  
help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large  
language models (LLMs). Researchers use prompt engineering to improve  
the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such  
as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt  
engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that   
interface with LLMs and other tools.
